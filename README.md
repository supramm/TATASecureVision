# 🛡️ TATASecure Vision 🚧  
### Smart vision safeguarding Tata Motors’ workforce.

Welcome to **TATASecure Vision** – a real-time, multi-model safety surveillance suite designed to **prevent accidents, ensure compliance**, and **safeguard lives** in industrial environments using the power of **Computer Vision + AI** 💡.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Industrial safety is non-negotiable. TATASecure Vision is an **end-to-end AI-powered system** that deploys **multiple custom-trained object detection models** on **live factory camera feeds** to ensure:

- **PPE Compliance**
- **Harness Safety at Heights**
- **Walking Within Safe Zones**
- **Kitchen/Factory Hazard Alerts**

These models are deployed on the edge and cloud via **Streamlit WebApps** to provide **real-time feedback** and decision support for on-ground supervisors and safety officers.

## 📦 Model Training Details

All models were trained using **Roboflow datasets** and annotated using **CVAT** and **Label Studio**. Here's a quick overview:

### 🦺 PPE Detection
- **Classes**: Safety Helmet, Vest, Glasses, Gloves, Boots  
- **Accuracy**: **93%**  
- **Dataset**: [Roboflow PPE Dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/supram/safety-pyazl-khx3r/)  
- **Deployment**: Cameras at **entry checkpoints**

### 🧗‍♂️ Safety Harness Detection
- **Classes**: Harness On / Harness Off  
- **Accuracy**: **98%**  
- **Dataset**: [Harness Detection Dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/supram/harness-knfmk-9ozbf/1)  
- **Deployment**: **Overhead cameras** in high-altitude workspaces

### 🚶‍♂️ Region Compliance Detection
- **Approach**: Trained on **live factory video feed**, and used **Shapely** for polygon detection  
- **Use Case**: Ensures workers stay within **green-lined safe zones**

### 🍳 Kitchen Safety Model
- **Goal**: Detect if **Kadhai with hot oil** is left **unattended > 5 mins**  
- **Custom Annotated Dataset**: [Kitchen Safety Dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/supram/kitchensafety/1)  
- **Annotation Tools**: **CVAT**, **Label Studio**  
- **Deployment**: **Factory canteen kitchens**
